Hi All,

Thank you for visiting the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) section. Please follow the instructions and guidance below for a structured and effective learning path:

Start by understanding Time Complexity
Focus on grasping how time complexity works. You can skip space complexity for now.

Learn Searching Algorithms
Understand basic and advanced searching techniques such as linear search and binary search.

Learn Sorting Algorithms
Study common sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.

Study Linear Data Structures
Make sure you're comfortable with the following:

ArrayList

Linked List

Stack

Queue

Map (HashMap, TreeMap, etc.)

No need to learn all Non-Linear Data Structures in depth
Instead, focus on understanding their real-world applications. This knowledge is often sufficient for interviews and practical use.

Let me know if you want this rewritten in a more casual or formal tone, or formatted for a blog, slide, or
